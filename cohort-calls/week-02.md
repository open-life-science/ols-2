[Yo] (⏰ 15 minutes) 45

*This is our first group break-out room, so we will spend 1-2 minutes introducing Zoom breakouts.*

👥 Break-out room (10 minutes, ~3 ppl per room):

- What was your path to this program?
- How did you get into working open?
- How has working open affected your leadership?

**Breakout room reminder:** if you need assistance in your breakout room, please click the **Ask for Help**; button at the bottom of your screen

Any insights/thoughts/comments to share from your breakout room?

- _Name / comment _

- Georgia/It was really exciting to hear more about some of the projects here - I think this is such a woderful community to be part of! 
-nenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenene
- Pradeep / Its great to hear others' projects and know how they are excited about starting their new project and how to take it from their current point of the project:  different perspectives and more learnings. 
- Camila / There was an interesting dicussion about how to we have to change the culture of science where being 'scooped' is big worry of working openly.  
- Ismael / An interesting chat came up about two aspects needed in reproducibility: technical tools/infrastructure + cultural buy-in
- Jez / A strong reminder that I have a lot more to learn from this community than I have to offer as a mentor, but that's ok because we're more than the sum of our parts. I hope I can serve you all well!
- Renato / We want to remove the word "scoop" from the dictionary by going full open, collaborative and inclusive +1 I love this! 
- Aidan: Was so lovely to chat and meet Hilya and Piv - connecting with y'all like this is one of the most exciting and enjoyable parts of this kind of work.
- Hilya: Second to Aidan. The breakout room was great. Had enjoyable conversation with Aidan and Piv. Love the idea of breakout room. This is very awesome community and program.

✏️ Project mission or vision
---

[Malvika Sharan](⏰ 10 min) 55

*Articulate your big idea, vision or dream that you want to achieve by working open, and experiment with expressing your vision in a short format.*

Add [your project mission or vision](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/stating-your-project-vision/) below we'll share in breakout rooms

_Add your project name / project vision below (2 min; silent GDoc-ing and +1ing)_

- Danny G. - Registered-Reports-in-Primate-Neurophysiology / "Work with neurophysiologists and metascientists to create a guide to using the registered report format specifically for researchers like them in our field so that we can reap the benefits of the format (peer review in advance of data collection, and reducing publication bias).

- Peter van Heusden / Develop RSSE-Africa (Research Software and Systems Engineers - Africa), a forum to provide a home for people whose main contribution to research is software and computing systems. The aim for 2020 is to grow the project in terms of visibility and participation.
- Teresa Laguna: Citizens’ daily problem solving by engaging multidisciplinary scientific communities: 
(Sci4All) / I will work with other scientists in generating scientific solutions to daily life problems for the general public in Madrid area which help them feel connected with Science in a way they can find it useful and let them acquire a more scientific mentality. I am working open because transparency is key to make the public engage with Science and scientists and viceversa.


    * [name=Sophia] would love to keep up with this project and how you're tying together disciplines. "crosspolination" of ideas is so so wonderful for science but often (ime) so hard to structure

- Ethical Research - The Turing Way ([name=Ismael], [name=Sophia] & [name=Laura]) / Our Vision is to create a framework that supports an ethical research mindset and its practical application within a researcher-driven data science community. The goal is to build a community (that's you!) that feels volitionally empowered to feed forward into the further development of these ethical science practices in a virtuous cycle. 
- [Autistica/Turing citizen science projecet](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/AutisticaCitizenScience)/ Our vision is to empower a communinty of autistic people and their supporters to co-design a citizen science platform so that we can gather data to help make built environments (such as public transport, workplaces and hospitals) more enabling for autistic people.
    * This looks like a great project and really important to centre autistic folks in the process :yellow_heart: [name=Jez]
- Creating communCreating commun[OpenWorkstation](https://github.com/SebastianEggert/OpenWorkstation) / Democratize access to laboratory automation.
- Open platform for Indian Bioinformatics community/ I would like to work with the Bioinformatics researchers in India to build a platform for learning through sharing the knowledge among the community members so that the community could grow together. (My vision statement is very brief at this stage, I am sure it will grow during OLS-2 along with my Open journey!)  - (Who wrote this? - PvH)
- Turing Data Stories (Kevin, Sam, Camila, Dave) / To build a community that encourages people to harness the potential of open data by creating socially relevant, reproducible and pedagogical data stories. Openness is embedded in every step of this project - from the data to the content and to the community driven peer review process. We want to create a platform through which authors can publish different data stories, whilst maintaining a high standard for openness and reproducibility. Our stories should provide pedagogical content and transparency in the process of extracting insight from the data. We hope this will develop our readers’ data literacy and help them better understand an increasingly data driven world.
- Practical Guide to Reproducibility in Bioinformatics / I'm (Sangram) working with like-minded people in the online community to work towards a practical approach to reproducibility in the field of Bioinformatics for the students and researches. In such a way that they can apply them on their day to day tasks. That will improve overall reproducibility and reusability in the field. 

- The Hub Portal/ To build a platform to connect science clubs in Kenyan Universities to collaborate and allow easy access to local data  / vision

- Project Free Our Knowledge / We're building a 'crowdacting' platform that helps researchers signal their desire for positive cultural change and then act collectively to bring it about, thus protecting individuals from unecessary risk as we practice open science together
    * [name=Laura] I'm really excited to follow this project! Such an important aim
    * [name=Jez] Fantastic goal, good luck!
    * [name=Cooper] thanks Laura and Jez! can follow the project on [twitter](https://twitter.com/home) and [Github](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/discussion)

- Chronic Learning / I'm working (hopefully, eventually with others) to create a repository of open, accessible educational resources for academics and individuals trying to teach or learn something new, so that the learning curve for new ideas is a manageable one.

- [name=Markus] & [name=Joel]'s Image Analysis Project: Create and share openly a new topological data analysis algorithm that can process noisy image analysis data that provides an alternative to computationally intensive and uninterpretable neural nets.

- [sktime](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime) [Markus]: We want to enable understandable and accessible machine learning with time series by providing instructive documentation and by building a friendly, collaborative and inclusive community. The aim is to unify the time series analysis field by providing a common framework for multiple learning tasks, bringing together contributors from academia and the wider data science community into a joint framework and embedding best practices into the time series analysis field
- Piv - supporting the creation and maintenance of bioinformatics training expertise in Latin America through open science and open education initiatives - both eLearning and live events.
- [APBioNet Talks](https://apbtalks.apbionet.org) [Hilya] - APBioNET Talks is a video-based open source platform with the simple mission of empowering the community through bioinformatics learning, education, and training. The program aims to facilitate the learning of bioinformatics to be more inclusive and accessible. In the process, we hope to further contribute to the existing knowledge pool and facilitate the discovery and sharing of bioinformatics.
- Open database-[Brenda, Jelioth and I (Harriet)] want to build an open database for open access immunology preprints and publications on covid-19 to make sharing & accessibility of information possible for scientists and interested parties working on or seeking information on this
- Open Phytolith Research - [Emma] The problem I am trying to solve is the lack of use of open science in my field, phytolith research, especially concerning reusable data sharing. Raising awareness of how a more open research community could benefit all researchers and improving knowledge of open science using training will help researchers to feel more confident to implement new ways of working. It will also help to build a community to start important collaborative work on drawing up discipline-specific guidelines for data sharing.

  - the process of writing the vision statement was hard but it really helped us think through what we wanted to achievehard but it really helped us think through waht +1
  - I think it is not easy to elaborate a vision when your project is in a very early stage
  - I love how there are chances across projects for people to meet others from their same fields!
  - I found one more person supporting my project and share his experience.
  - 
  - - 
  -  the community building side of it seems to be the most "intangible" part - in that we know we want to contribute something ourselves but the point is to be able to support and build the foundations for others. +1 
  		-  this is important to my project to :+1: 
     - wonderful to hear from people who are starting new projects, they seem really exciting and important. So excited to see how they involve

🤔 Read through and reflect on your role as a mentee and a project leader in OLS-2
---

Let's ask ourselves: **Am I mentorable?**

*“mentorability” refers to the ability of mentees to benefit from mentoring.* 

“The mentee is the driver, and the mentor is the copilot, helping them get to their destination.” - Victoria Black ([reference](https://ideas.ted.com/are-you-mentorable/))

*Reflection and insights: **Please add +1 next to what applies to your current understanding**. After completing this exercise, please reflect on these roles in the context of your project*

**My role:**

- I am aware of the areas where I want help from my mentor (and other members)
- I understand that my role as a project lead is to hold the accountability of my goals
- I am open to my mentor's input and I aim to respond to their advice (and sometimes criticism) while exploring those in the context of my project
- I understand that some days I may not meet all my goals - and that's OK! We are here to learn from each other - not compete!

**My mentor's role:**

- I am mindful and respectful of my mentor’s time and advice
- I know that my mentors are not my supervisor, but they are there to support me in my personal growth in OLS 
- Based on open and reciprocal communication, they are there to guide me in the right direction, not "work" on my project.

**If working in team**

- We have discussed our roles as individuals in this project
- We have identified (or will identify in OLS-2) how to set goals and expectations, divide responsibilities and acknowledge each other's work
- I intend to listen to my team members' needs, give continual feedback about my needs, and identify the next steps in our project together
- Knowing that we all have different living situations and personal responsibilities, I commit to empathetically supporting my team members. 

### Assignments before the next cohort call (week-4)

1. Share the image/link on your GitHub issue and look up at least two other projects in the issues and comment on their issues with feedback on their vision statement.
3. [Start your Roadmap](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/) and comment on your issue with your draft Roadmap.

### Next calls
